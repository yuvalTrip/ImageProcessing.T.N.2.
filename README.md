# ImageProcessing.T.N.2.

The system used to run the task was Windows 10 PC, using PyCharm on python 3.8.

The functions implemented in the assignment:
* conv1D- Convolve a 1-D array with a given kernel
* flipped_mat- Transpose given kernel
* conv2D- Convolve a 2-D array with a given kernel
* convDerivative- Calculate gradient of an image
* blurImage1- Blur an image using a Gaussian kernel
* createGaussianKer
* gaussKernel
* blurImage2- Blur an image using a Gaussian kernel using OpenCV built-in functions
* edgeDetectionZeroCrossingLOG- Detecting edges using "ZeroCrossingLOG" method
* find_crossing_zero- find edges by find the + 0 - or + -
* houghCircle- Find Circles in an image using a Hough Transform algorithm extension
* bilateral_filter_implement- Implementention of the Bilateral filter
